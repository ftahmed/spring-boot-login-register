# Login Register Example For Spring Boot

## Thymeleaf, Maven, PostgreSQL, JPA, Spring Security, SecurityFilterChain

In this project, we are using roles as containers of authorities/privileges.
* An expression like hasRole(“ADMIN”), we are restricting access in a coarse-grained manner.
* An expression like hasAuthority(‘READ_AUTHORITY’), we are restricting access in a fine-grained manner.
